## 🔗 Powering the Current Bot

The s1mple.ai frontend communicates over HTTPS with a secure GCP-hosted backend that orchestrates:

1. **APIFY API** scrapers and connectors  
2. **OpenAI** (and other LLMs) for reasoning, synthesis, and natural-language understanding  
3. A dynamically extensible tool registry, so you can plug in any additional API, database, or service

This layered design **surpasses conventional front-end limits**—think of it like adding **your own custom plugins** into a super-charged AI assistant. Whatever data your business needs, you can expose it as an agent, chain it into a workflow, and let the AI do the rest.

---

## 🧩 Building Custom Tools

1. **Define** your API endpoint or data source.  
2. **Register** it in the Dashboard under **Tools → Add Custom Tool**.  
3. **Map** inputs/outputs so agents know how to call it.  
4. **Use** it in any agent or chain—just as you would Gmail or Trading integrations.

> _Analogy:_ Just as you can install plugins in your browser to add new features, you can “install” any API into s1mple.ai to extend your AI agents’ capabilities.
